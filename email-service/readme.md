Let's implement the Email Service using Node.js. This service will handle all email communications, working alongside our Auth and User services to send verification emails, password reset links, and notifications.

Let me explain how to set up and run the Email Service:

First, create the project structure:

bashCopymkdir email-service
cd email-service
npm init -y

Create a .env file with your email configuration:

bashCopySMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-specific-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourapp.com
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

Install the dependencies:

bashCopynpm install express nodemailer amqplib winston dotenv handlebars joi

Start the service:

bashCopynpm run dev
The Email Service will now handle:

User verification emails
Password reset emails
Welcome emails
Notification emails

Our next steps should be:

Set up service discovery using Eureka, which will help our services find and communicate with each other
Implement the API Gateway to route requests to appropriate services
Create a Docker Compose file to run all services together
Set up monitoring and logging
Implement integration tests

Would you like me to help you implement any of these components? Setting up service discovery would be a logical next step as it will help coordinate communication between all our services.
Some important considerations for the email service:

Email templates can be customized further based on your needs
Consider implementing email queue retry logic
Add rate limiting to prevent spam
Implement email tracking analytics
Set up email delivery status monitoring
